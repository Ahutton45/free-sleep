For tearing pod4 down: just remove the 4 screws under the rubber feet on the bottom. 

I believe they are T10 torx bits. I don't recall. If you have an assorted kit of torx bits you should be good. 

Put your left and right hands on the left and right panels and lift upwards to lift the hub off the base panel (bottom panel). The left and right panels aren't connected, but they slide down to remove. Careful not to drop your hub while you are lifting as the panels are not connected. 

Put a towel down, or something soft, on the table or edge of counter. 

Put the hub at the edge of a the counter on the towel, then remove the left panel. It will slide downwards about 1/2 inch, then you can pull it off. 

Rotate. 

Remove the right panel. Same thing. 1/2 inch down then pull outwards 

Now the front mesh grille / panel should slide off easily. It will also slide down ~1/2 inch, then pull outwards easily. 

Note: there are tabs at the top and bottom of the front panel. These are annoying to get back into the correct position when you're putting everything back together.  Take note of how these tabs slide into the top panel, and the bottom panel

You need to put the panel in place to line up the tabs, then slide it upwards. Then put the side panels back on. Lift the hub by keeping one hand on each side panel. 

Put the bottom panel at the edge of a counter or table. Put the hub/side panels back onto the base panel - carefully lining up the tabs on the front grille, such that they end up in the slots on the bottom panel. 

After all the panel are back in place, put the bolts back in and put the rubber feet back on.
